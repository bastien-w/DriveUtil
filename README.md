This script is used to map or unmap a drive on a Windows system. It accepts several parameters:

Action: This is a mandatory parameter that can take two values: ‘Install’ or ‘Uninstall’. ‘Install’ is used to map a drive, and ‘Uninstall’ is used to unmap a drive.

Name: This mandatory parameter specifies the name of the drive to be mapped or unmapped.

Path: This is a mandatory parameter when the action is ‘Install’. It specifies the path that should be mapped to the drive.

Persist: This optional parameter indicates whether the mapping should persist across reboots. It defaults to $true.

Force: This optional parameter, when set to $true, forces the removal of the drive name if it’s already in use when trying to map a drive. It defaults to $false.

PsProvider: This optional parameter specifies the PowerShell provider to use. It can be ‘FileSystem’ or ‘Registry’ and defaults to ‘FileSystem’.

Scope: This optional parameter specifies the scope of the drive mapping. It can be ‘Global’, ‘Local’, or ‘Script’ and defaults to ‘Global’.
The script also creates a log file named ‘DriveUtil.txt’ in the ‘ALLUSERSPROFILE’ directory. This log file records the actions performed by the script, including any errors that occur.

If the Action is ‘Install’, the script attempts to map the specified Path to the Name. If the Force parameter is $true, it first tries to unmap any existing drive with the same Name. If the mapping is successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs the error message.

If the Action is ‘Uninstall’, the script attempts to unmap the drive specified by Name. If the unmapping is successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs the error message.
